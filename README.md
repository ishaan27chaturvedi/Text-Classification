# Text-Classification

Comparing models like skip-gram neural network, LSTMs, CNNs and BiDirectional LSTMs for Text Classification tasks using word embeddings

## Description

### word2vec
Using word2vec to extract an embedding layer to visualize the similarity matrix between words using the t-SNE method.

### LSTM models
Conducted Text Classification using LSTM models with various enhancements

### LSTM and CNN using GloVe
Comparing the performance of LSTMs with CNNs on various text classification tasks. Also used GloVe pretrained embeddings to boost performance.

### Sentiment Analysis
Conducted Sentiment Analysis using LSTMs, CNNs and models with multi inputs. Also used GloVe pretrained embeddings to boost performance.
